Code for the paper "Boosting Causal Embeddings via Potential Verb-Mediated Causal Patterns".



**Data Preprocess**

1. To extract `(Subject, Verb, Object)` triples, run

```bash
cd boostvec/en/prepare/
python extract_svo_triples.py
```

This will generate a output file, where data columns are split by '----' and the columns on each line are:

```bash
- original sentence
- subject phrase
- object phrase
- postag of subjec phrase
- postag of object phrase
- verb pattern
```

2. To generate seed set of `causal word pairs`, run

```bash
python positive_wp.py
```

3. Using previous data resources including (S,V,O) triples and causal word pairs, `pwp matrix` can be generated by

```bash
python pwp_matrix.py
```

**Pattern weighting and scoring**

1. Using positive and negative samples generated by previous stage, the weight of each verb patterns can be obtained by

```bash
cd boostvec/en/nn/pattern/
python pattern_weighting.py
```

2. To calculate causal affinities of potential causal pattern, run

```python
python pattern_scoring.py
```

**Boosting Max-Matching**

Then, run

```bash
cd boostvec/en/nn/embed/
python bmm.py
```

This will generate 2 output files, as `boosted_cause_embedding.txt` and `boosted_effect_embedding.txt`.


**Result**
